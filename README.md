Conclusion
The  contract has features of:
• Protecting against reentrancy.
• Adding proper access control mechanisms.
• Clearly defining Ether management and removing unnecessary
functionality.
If the contract intends to incorporate funds transfer in the future, additional mechanisms like
pull-over-push patterns or dedicated escrow functionality should be implemented to ensure
secure Ether transfers
